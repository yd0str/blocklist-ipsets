# [ATLAS Scans] (https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/scans) - 
# Host scanning is a process whereby automated network sweeps 
# are initiated in search of hosts running a particular 
# service. This may be indicative of either legitimate host 
# scanners (including network management systems and 
# authorized vulnerability scanners) or an attacker (or 
# automated malicious code, such as a worm) trying to 
# enumerate potential hosts for subsequent compromise. Scans 
# are often the prelude to an attack, and services scanned by 
# attackers usually indicate known vulnerabilities for those 
# services. Types of port scans include connect() scans, SYN 
# scans, stealth scans, bounce scans, XMAS and Null scans. 
# All reveal to the attacker which services on what hosts are 
# listening for connections. Scans may be launched from 
# compromised hosts, and their sources may be forged.
