These servers are installed on compromised web servers or botnets, at times. Phishing Web sites mimic legitimate Web sites, often of a financial institution, in order to steal logins, passwords, and personal information. Attackers trick users into using the fake Web site by sending the intended victim an e-mail claiming to be a legitimate institution requesting the information for valid reasons, such as account verification. They may then use the stolen credentials to withdraw large amounts of money from the victim's account or commit other fraudulent acts. Most targeted brands are usually in the financial sector, including banks and online commerce sites. ",
