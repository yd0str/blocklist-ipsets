The data are processed and clasified every week and behaviour of IP addresses that accessed a larger number of Turris routers is evaluated. The result is a list of addresses that have tried to obtain information about services on the router or tried to gain access to them. We do not recommend to use these data as a list of addresses that should be blocked but it can be used for example in analysis of the traffic in other networks. ",
