	"info": "<a href=\"https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/scans\">ATLAS Scans</a>  - Host scanning is a process whereby automated network sweeps are initiated in search of hosts running a particular service. This may be indicative of either legitimate host scanners (including network management systems and authorized vulnerability scanners)  or an attacker (or automated malicious code, such as a worm)  trying to enumerate potential hosts for subsequent compromise. Scans are often the prelude to an attack, and services scanned by attackers usually indicate known vulnerabilities for those services. Types of port scans include connect()  scans, SYN scans, stealth scans, bounce scans, XMAS and Null scans. All reveal to the attacker which services on what hosts are listening for connections. Scans may be launched from compromised hosts, and their sources may be forged. ",
